# BinauralSync

**BinauralSync** is a web-based application for exploring the effects of binaural beats—auditory illusions created when two tones of slightly different frequencies are played in each ear. This app allows users to generate and experiment with customizable binaural tones aimed at facilitating focused, relaxed, or meditative states.

## 📄 Background

Binaural beats are auditory illusions created by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear, resulting in the perception of a third frequency—the difference between them. These phenomena have been studied for their potential to affect brainwave states.

This app includes presets inspired by the "Focus Levels" outlined in the **Gateway Process**, a series of consciousness expansion techniques developed by the **Monroe Institute** and documented by the **CIA** in the 1983 report:

## 🎧 What Are Binaural Beats?

When two tones of slightly different frequencies are played into each ear, the brain perceives a third tone — a binaural beat — which is the difference between the two frequencies. For example, if 210 Hz is played in the left ear and 200 Hz in the right, a 10 Hz binaural beat is perceived. Research suggests that different beat frequencies may correlate with different mental states.

## 🧠 Brainwave States Presets

| State      | Beat Frequency | Description                     |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Delta      | 0.5 - 4 Hz     | Deep sleep, unconsciousness     |
| Theta      | 4 - 8 Hz       | Deep relaxation, meditation     |
| Alpha      | 8 - 12 Hz      | Relaxed alertness               |
| Beta       | 12 - 30 Hz     | Active thinking, concentration  |
| Gamma      | 30 - 100 Hz    | Higher mental activity          |

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
